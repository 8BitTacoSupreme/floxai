# Brand New User Experience Test

## Scenario: Developer wants AI assistance for their project

### User Profile:
- Has Flox installed
- Working on a Python project
- Wants AI code assistance
- No knowledge of FloxAI internals

## Test Cases

### 1. Minimal AI Chat (Just need Claude integration)
```bash
# User just wants basic AI chat in their existing environment
flox activate -r 8bittacosupreme/floxai-base    # Get Python runtime
flox activate -r 8bittacosupreme/floxai-llm     # Add Claude AI

# Verify what they have
floxai-base   # Shows: "FloxAI Base Component v1.0.3"
floxai-llm    # Shows: "FloxAI LLM Component v1.0.3"
```

### 2. Full Knowledge-Aware Development
```bash
# User wants AI + knowledge base
flox activate -r 8bittacosupreme/floxai-base
flox activate -r 8bittacosupreme/floxai-rag
flox activate -r 8bittacosupreme/floxai-llm

# Or use composition in their project
cat > .flox/env/manifest.toml << 'EOF'
version = 1

[include]
environments = [
    { remote = "8bittacosupreme/floxai-base" },
    { remote = "8bittacosupreme/floxai-rag" },
    { remote = "8bittacosupreme/floxai-llm" }
]

[install]
# User's project dependencies
pytest.pkg-path = "python313Packages.pytest"
EOF

flox activate  # Gets FloxAI + their project deps
```

### 3. Complete System (Turn-key experience)
```bash
# User wants everything ready to go
flox activate -r 8bittacosupreme/floxai-complete

# Shows full banner and setup
floxai-setup  # Initialize if needed
floxai        # Run complete system
```

### 4. Discoverable via Search
```bash
flox search floxai
# Expected results:
# 8bittacosupreme/floxai-base      - Core runtime and dependencies
# 8bittacosupreme/floxai-rag       - Knowledge base and vector search
# 8bittacosupreme/floxai-llm       - Claude integration and AI services
# 8bittacosupreme/floxai-complete  - Complete FloxAI system
```

## Expected Benefits for Users

### ðŸŽ¯ Flexibility
- **Pick what you need**: Only base + LLM for simple AI chat
- **Full experience**: Complete system for comprehensive AI assistance
- **Project integration**: Compose with existing environments

### ðŸš€ No Setup Overhead
- **No cloning**: Components download automatically
- **No dependencies**: Everything pre-packaged
- **No configuration**: Secure key prompts built-in

### ðŸ”„ Easy Experimentation
- **Try components**: Layer temporarily to test
- **Switch modes**: From minimal to full as needs evolve
- **Clean removal**: Exit to remove, no cleanup needed

### ðŸ“š Gradual Learning
- **Start simple**: Base + LLM for basic AI assistance
- **Add features**: Layer RAG when knowledge base needed
- **Understand pieces**: Each component shows what it provides

## Success Metrics

âœ… **User can get AI assistance in < 30 seconds**
âœ… **No need to understand FloxAI internals**
âœ… **Components work in any existing project**
âœ… **Clear upgrade path from minimal to full**
âœ… **Self-documenting (components explain themselves)**

## Migration for Current Users

Current FloxAI users see no changes - their environment continues working exactly as before. New modular approach is additive, not replacing.
